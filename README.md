# Katy
Simple tool for finding problems on codeforces

## Overview
I built this simple tool to personal practice. It suggests you some problems from codeforces that are unsolved by you and you can specify other features like tags and problem ratings

## How to use 

1. Please be patient while fetching the problem set from codeforces

2. You should now enter the desired handles (one of more). If you didn't specify, the default handle will be tourist 
3. Then you need to tell the range of problems rating (the default will be 800 - 1200)

5. Finally, you choose how many problems do you want and shall get your problemset automatically opened in your default browser
